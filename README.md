# TripPlannerLite (iOS)

A lightweight iOS trip-planning application built with **SwiftUI** and **SwiftData** that allows users to create, view, and delete trips with persistent on-device storage.

## Overview

TripPlannerLite demonstrates core iOS development concepts including:

- Declarative UI design with SwiftUI  
- Local data persistence using SwiftData  
- List management with dynamic state updates  
- Swipe-to-delete user interaction patterns  
- MVVM-style separation of concerns  

This project highlights foundational skills required for modern **mobile software engineering roles**.
